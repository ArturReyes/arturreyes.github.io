      I'm currently and independent developer building things for the web with a lot of awesome people. Interestingly, I have always been interested in web development since those MySpace 
      days where you could create your own little corner in the web-- turns out hacking together a custom theme taught me a lot about HTML and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.uabc.mx/en/" target="_blank">Universidad Aut√≥noma de Baja California</a> after completing an awesome six-month co-op at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>.

      As a web developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between ideas and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build sites that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably on roadtrips enjoying the beautiful Baja,
      or crossing off another film on my watchlist.
